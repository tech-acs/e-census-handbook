Introduction","description":"The enumeration phase is among the most important stages  for a population and housing census that happens after years of preparatory activities. The main objective of enumeration is to ensure that all individuals are covered and enumerated only once to achieve a proper description of the total population of a country and its geographical distribution within the country.","sidebar":"experiencesLessons2020Sidebar"},"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/11.1. PES Independence and Other Assumptions":{"id":"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/11.1. PES Independence and Other Assumptions","title":"11.1. PES Independence and Other Assumptions","description":"The PES should be conducted independently from the census as there is an assumption made that a person is no more or less likely to respond to the PES given whether they responded to the census or not. This assumption will always be violated to some extent because a person who does not want to be counted is unlikely to respond to either the census to the PES. However, steps should be taken to ensure that independence is maintained as far as possible, and that when the independence assumption is broken, this is understood and accounted for in the subsequent analysis.","sidebar":"experiencesLessons2020Sidebar"},"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/11.10.

Recommendations":{"id":"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/11.9. Recommendations","title":"11.9. Recommendations","description":"The PES should be planned and budgeted for as an integral part of the census operations. A PES is unlikely to yield useful results if it is a last-minute addition only considered once the census operation has been completed. As such, unless the PES is properly planned and executed it is unlikely to yield value for money as the results may not be valid. Consider whether or not carrying out a PES is a good use of resource.","sidebar":"experiencesLessons2020Sidebar"},"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/introduction":{"id":"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/introduction","title":"11. Introduction","description":"A census post-enumeration survey (PES) is a survey carried out in a sample of EAs soon after the census enumeration has been completed. The main purpose of a PES is to assess the undercoverage of the census enumeration i.e., to estimate the number of people who have been missed from the census. However, the PES can also contribute to an assessment of census overcoverage i.e., people who have been counted in the census twice. The PES can also be used to verify the accuracy of responses for some key census questions. Even if census figures are not adjusted according to the result of the PES analysis, the estimates of the true population calculated should feed into population projections. Finally, lessons learned from the PES can inform the improved design of future censuses and surveys.","sidebar":"experiencesLessons2020Sidebar"},"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-12/12.2.
