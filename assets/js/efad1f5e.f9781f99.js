The initial tests carried out during census preparations include testing of tools and instruments often referred to as census pretest and these can be several and on a small scale for different purposes.

During implementation of preparatory activities, effective communication is key to mobilize the required support from all the stakeholders. During census planning, adequate resources for census communication activities should be mobilized. After census, communication of the results to the various stakeholders in the right format and time is key.","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-08/References":{"id":"chapter-08/References","title":"References","description":"1\\thttps://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2016/demo/stic-publicity-final.pdf","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-09/9.1- ICT- infrastructure":{"id":"chapter-09/9.1- ICT- infrastructure","title":"9.1- ICT- infrastructure","description":"9.1 ICT infrastructure","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-09/9.2-Technological-Innovations":{"id":"chapter-09/9.2-Technological-Innovations","title":"9.2-Technological-Innovations","description":"9.2 Technological Innovations","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-09/9.3-Data-Transmission":{"id":"chapter-09/9.3-Data-Transmission","title":"9.3-Data-Transmission","description":"9.3.

The main purpose of a PES is to assess the undercoverage of the census enumeration i.e., to estimate the number of people who have been missed from the census. However, the PES can also contribute to an assessment of census overcoverage i.e., people who have been counted in the census twice. The PES can also be used to verify the accuracy of responses for some key census questions. Even if census figures are not adjusted according to the result of the PES analysis, the estimates of the true population calculated should feed into population projections. Finally, lessons learned from the PES can inform the improved design of future censuses and surveys.","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-11/Lessons_Learned_PES":{"id":"chapter-11/Lessons_Learned_PES","title":"Lessons Learned","description":"1. \\tIf person and household information (demographic and metadata) is processed as two separate datasets, ensure that there is an easy and unambiguous way to join this information back together again as automatic matching will rely on using information from both datasets.","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-11/Matching":{"id":"chapter-11/Matching","title":"Matching","description":"Once the PES enumeration phase has been collected, the next stage of PES processing is to match the PES persons to the census persons.","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-11/PES_Enumeration":{"id":"chapter-11/PES_Enumeration","title":"PES Enumeration","description":"Nearly all the stages of census enumeration will also apply to PES enumeration see Enumeration.

This assumption will always be violated to some extent because a person who does not want to be counted is unlikely to respond to either the census to the PES.
