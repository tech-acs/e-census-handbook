For example, to estimate the undercount at national level, requires a smaller sample size than to estimate the undercount at a regional level. A sample of Enumeration Areas (EAs) is selected ensuring that the sample is representative of the population including EAs from all parts of the country and a mixture of urban and rural geographies. The sample may be weighted to include proportionately more EAs that are considered hard to enumerate, since these EAs are likely to be more informative.\nThe PES concentrates on persons and households only, so make sure that EAs selected for the PES do include residential properties and are not just made up of commercial or communal establishments such as hospitals or army camps.
