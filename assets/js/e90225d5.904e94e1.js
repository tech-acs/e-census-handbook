It called on ECA, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other development partners to continue supporting countries in the implementation of the 2020 round of censuses and in preparation for the 2030 round.\nIn response to the 8th STATCOM recommendation, ECA through the African Centre for Statistics (ACS) that has a core function of contributing to setting up and undertaking digital censuses in Africa with the aim to implement modern data collection practices using new technology and methodologies has made progress.\nDuring the 2020 census round, information and communication technology across the globe has changed how routine statistical business processes are being done. Therefore, a systematic planning approach needs be used to achieve the best intended gains from the PHC. The ACS, in strengthening innovative approaches by countries during the 2020 censuses, identified the need to streamline the census planning process to inform the 2030 census round."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>c});var o=n(6540);const i={},s=o.createContext(i);function r(e){const t=o.useContext(s);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function c(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),o.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
