Introduction",description:"A census post-enumeration survey (PES) is a survey carried out in a sample of EAs soon after the census enumeration has been completed. The main purpose of a PES is to assess the undercoverage of the census enumeration i.e., to estimate the number of people who have been missed from the census. However, the PES can also contribute to an assessment of census overcoverage i.e., people who have been counted in the census twice. The PES can also be used to verify the accuracy of responses for some key census questions. Even if census figures are not adjusted according to the result of the PES analysis, the estimates of the true population calculated should feed into population projections. Finally, lessons learned from the PES can inform the improved design of future censuses and surveys.",source:"@site/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/introduction.md",sourceDirName:"experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11",slug:"/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/introduction",permalink:"/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/introduction",draft:!1,unlisted:!1,editUrl:"https://github.com/tech-acs/e-census-handbook/tree/main/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-11/introduction.md",tags:[],version:"current",sidebarPosition:1,frontMatter:{sidebar_position:1},sidebar:"experiencesLessons2020Sidebar",previous:{title:"Chapter 11: Post-Enumeration Survey",permalink:"/e-census-handbook/docs/category/chapter-11-post-enumeration-survey"},next:{title:"11.1.

Whilst a well conducted PES will yield value insights into the quality of the census coverage and accuracy, it can be a time and money consuming exercise. If the results are not used because, for example, there is too much uncertainty in the estimates, then the time and money spent on the PES may have been better used elsewhere e.g., in improving the quality of the census coverage. If a PES is going to be conducted, then it should be planned and funded as an integral part of the census, and should not be carried out as an after thought or a tick-box exercise."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Post-Enumeration Survey during the non-digital vs digital era"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Since both census and PES data will be collected electronically, automatic matching techniques can be applied to match the data together, an essential stage of PES analysis. This should be borne in mind when designing the PES questionnaire and CAPI application so that everything is done to make automatic matching as successful as possible. Training the enumerators so that they understand well how the data will be used for matching is also important. For example, accurate collection of names and dates of birth will improve the automatic matchrate. Use of automatic matching techniques is likely to decrease the amount of time required for matching from several months to just weeks. The size of the clerical matching team can also be reduced. This saves time and money and means that initial census outputs can be released in a timelier manner."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var s=n(6540);const o={},a=s.createContext(o);function i(e){const t=s.useContext(a);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),s.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
