During verification, several NGAOs were brought together.\nAdditionally, the verification process identified missing features/facilities, spelling mistakes, confirmed the number of villages and boundaries, etc.  The key tools were therefore the sub-location map and geo-file. The exercise started after several EA maps had been produced for a number of counties. It was conducted in phases where in each phase several counties were covered.\nVerified maps and verification forms were forwarded to the map production office to effect the changes that had been documented before final production of maps. Major errors noted during verification included: spelling errors, wrong village/EA naming, incorrect EA numbering, disjointed/fragmented (Flying ) villages, omission of features, gaps where some households had not been mapped, unclear boundaries, incomplete naming of features. 32% of the EAs had one or more of the above errors.\nSierra Leone:  The verification process was followed up with a ground truthing exercise.
