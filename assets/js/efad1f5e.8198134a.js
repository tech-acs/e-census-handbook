The information is provided voluntarily by the various stakeholders, reviewed, and published in the handbook for reference especially with the countries planning to undertake a PHC and informing planning for the 2030 Round of PHC in Africa. It is a \u2018living\u2019 document \u2013 to be updated as more NSOs undertake censuses, evaluate, and identify new lessons/experiences and approaches. It will grow to accommodate new experiences and lessons as countries undertake and evaluate their censuses.","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-01/references":{"id":"chapter-01/references","title":"1.6 References","description":"1.

The main purpose of a PES is to assess the undercoverage of the census enumeration i.e., to estimate the number of people who have been missed from the census. However, the PES can also contribute to an assessment of census overcoverage i.e., people who have been counted in the census twice. The PES can also be used to verify the accuracy of responses for some key census questions. Even if census figures are not adjusted according to the result of the PES analysis, the estimates of the true population calculated should feed into population projections. Finally, lessons learned from the PES can inform the improved design of future censuses and surveys.","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-12/introduction":{"id":"chapter-12/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"},"chapter-13/introduction":{"id":"chapter-13/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"","sidebar":"handbookSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
