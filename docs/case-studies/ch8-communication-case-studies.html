<p>In Kenya, dissemination involved packaging, distributing, and making available census results in the most effective manner, as well as encouraging wide usage of the data. Data dissemination processes were guided by the dissemination policy which addressed the principles, conditions, technical aspects, and the way KNBS disseminates statistics to users for research and other purposes.</p>
<p>The Dissemination process utilized included: Public launch of the census results; Publishing basic reports and monographs from the census data; Organizing media forums to share the results; Holding National and County dissemination workshops; Posting results on KNBS website and data portal; production of digital storage media- DVDs, CDs and USB drives; Participating in public platforms for exhibitions e.g. Agricultural Society of Kenya shows; Library – The KNBS library stores publications as reference materials for researchers and the general public; Use of social media—twitter, you-tube,  face book handle to share key highlights; Engagement of the media through media workshop briefs/breakfast meeting briefs; TV and Radio to share the key highlights.</p>
<p>KNBS tried to involve all stakeholders in census data dissemination planning, especially engagement with the Office of the President to give releases legitimacy and wider coverage. It is important to encourage structures that allow the engagement of key stakeholders from the start of the Census process. KNBS was obliged to release census data or grant access to the data when it is satisfied that all reasonable steps have been considered to safeguard confidentiality of the respondents taking into considerations the country’s legal framework on freedom of information, data protection, and ethical considerations; KNBS shares data/information to individuals or institutions after official release. Kenya was faced with inadequate resources to undertake disseminations to the lower sub national levels.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe produced 8 preliminary reports on a modular basis to provide quick feedback to the 2022 PHC users. Data on census preliminary reports was supposed to be used during 2023 National budget preparation and delimitation of constituency boundaries. Hybrid dissemination workshops were held both physically and virtually using Zoom and Team platforms. Subject matter discussions were also held. The census results were also presented to two Cabinet meetings. The reports were also uploaded on the website <a href="http://www.zimstat.co.zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.zimstat.co.zw</a> and Census page on the ODP was created. Social Media was used like: Live streaming of presentation of results on Facebook (Zimstat), Twitter posts and updates (@zimstat), WhatsApp; Electronic and Print media: Invited journalists to attend dissemination workshops, Interviews in local languages Shona and Ndebele held; various Infographics.  Some of the products that were generated included: Census National Report; 10 Census Provincial Profile Reports; Vital Statistics Report from 2022 PHC data; 16 Census Thematic Reports building on 2012 experience; Census Atlas; and Thematic maps.</p>
<p>The following dissemination methods will be used for the outstanding products: posters, leaflets, wall charts, population datasheets, flyers and brochures will be produced and distributed in all the provinces and districts; Round table discussions and seminars for thematic reports; Media briefs, media releases and fact sheets for all the products. To allow for greater access, the 2022 Population and Housing Census dataset will be added onto the REDATAM-based census database systems which are currently uploaded onto the ZIMSTAT website (<a href="http://www.zimstat.co.zw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.zimstat.co.zw</a>). This will allow users to generate user-defined tables, graphs and maps using the 2022 Population and Housing Census data.

<blockquote>
<p>Mozambique engaged various stakeholders (political parties, ministry&#x27;s, medias, NGOs, Donors, etc) from questionnaire development stage to dissemination stage. A dissemination plan was elaborated and implemented in accordance with stakeholders’ segmentation in which they grouped the users into various groups, identified the purpose for which they use the statistics produced, and the format that would be most useful to a given group.</p>
<p>The groups included: Universities (students/professors) and researchers; Development Cooperation Agencies, donors, international NGOs, and the United Nations; children and teenagers; Entrepreneurs, Banks, and Private Sector; Government; media; Politicians; Statistics Producers (INE, Bank of Mozambique, SEN members); People with special needs / people with disabilities; General public (using an inclusive methodology); Civil society, NGOs and religious institutions. INE mapped suitable formats for each user group and designed a product for each segment, including school children (e.g. comics for the Youth).</p>
<p>In the last census (2007) the thematic studies were written by NSO staff in collaboration with local universities. Differently, with 2017 census the approach was to use consultants. This imposed challenge on data use by consultants that require deep involvement of INE staff;  When users are involved, making data available, explaining how to use and interpret the data, they respond positively; (example, NSO stabilized a partnership with media association, reining the media and stabilizing flexible communication channels such as WhatsApp; NSO created journalistic award; In response: all media refer to the NSO when talking about statistics; they constantly request for data and clarifications in the WhatsApp group; weekly they publish something about statistics; The average visits increased from 171,207  (2017 and 2018) to  288,721 (2020 and 2021)</p>

<p>The first Census in Swaziland was conducted in 1956 and since then, following the United Nations recommendations, the Government has kept up to the 10 years schedule. The last census to be conducted was in 2017 census. The census preliminary report was published within four months (September 2017) after enumeration, the thematic reports were done after 30 months (December 2019) after enumeration and the population projections was done in August 2020 (more than 3 years). These reports were printed and availed in soft copy on USB flash disks, and on the Central Statistics Office and Government website. Each report was disseminated as soon as they were published, through stakeholder workshops and electronically for individual user requests.</p>
