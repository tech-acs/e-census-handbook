## ICT Infrastructure
[back to Handbook section](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-09/ict-infrastructure)

### Kenya
>The choice to use mobile technology for data collection was based on the existing extensive of mobile technology usage in Kenya, wide network coverage, reduced price of owning mobile devices, and improved ICT literacy levels among other reasons.
>
>Android tablets and phones were chosen due to their affordability and availability of platforms for mobile application development tools. Mobile technologies were used for cartographic mapping, pilot tested and used in the main census enumeration.
>
>Two local universities premised on their proven experience in successful delivery of tablets were used to assemble the mobile devices and installed census software and related census files. 

### Sierra Leone
>Procured the Enumeration Area Pad software 4.0 license and satellite imagery with recent footprint of all structures and other features. Data was downloaded via google cloud from the mapping assistants in the field to the respective District Offices using onscreen digitization of delineated Enumeration Areas using ARCGIS Mapping software tool. 
>
>Each technological instrument intended for use in census data collection activity was available during the preparation period, and fully tested with other related applications. 
The local mobile companies provided the internet services at an agreed fee and this played a vital role working with servers at Statistics Sierra Leone Head Quarters to aid transfer of data directly from the field to main offices.

### Botswana
>Acquisition of tablets was done through a local procurement and donation from UNFPA Botswana.  

## Technological Innovations
[back to Handbook section](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-09/9.2.%20Technological%20Innovations)

#### Kenya
>The provisioning process was highly automated and required minimal human interaction. A network was set up to connect all the various hardware together so that the provisioning process can take place in a scalable and reliable manner. The network was relatively simple and self-contained and did not require Internet connectivity. After provisioning of the tablets, quality assurance was done to check if the provisioned tablets were ready for enumeration in the field again this was highly automated and required minimal human interaction such as pressing the volume button. 

#### Botswana
>The Manage Engine Mobile Device Manager plus App (MDM) was used to remotely manage the devices. It included features like device enrolment, App Management, Remote Troubleshooting, device security, location tracking and Audit Reports. It also helps in wiping the data in case the device is stolen or lost. A standard MDM tool can also track inventory of devices and perform real-time monitoring and reporting. A virtual server for MDM system was created. To allow for troubleshooting in the field, all Statistics Botswana IT Officers were given rights to log in to the system with their Domain Credentials to create Zoho account and use Zoho Assist.

## Data Transmission
[back to Handbook section](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-09/9.3.%20Data%20Transmission)

### Kenya
>All enumerators were sending their data to the server at the headquarters daily and whenever there was no internet, they would send data to the supervisor via Bluetooth that was configured between supervisor’s and enumerator’s devices. The supervisors would run pre-selected reports and review the data to check for its completeness before uploading the data to the server. A robust server was thus required to handle the magnitude of traffic and hits that were expected during the enumeration process. At the back end, the authorized personnel were pulling the data from the server to evaluate its quality and inform the respective field personnel in case data was inconsistent. In addition, they were also preparing monitoring reports.

### Sierra Leone
>The mapping PAD Application (a Data acquisition package built by Milsat Technologies) did a direct export of data to CSV format and the Headquarter offices downloaded the data through a cloud server system. 

### Botswana
>Data transfer to and from the servers was done through mobile data from sim cards loaded with different data packages depending on the role of end users for all the tablets or use of WIFI.

## Data Security
[back to Handbook section](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-09/9.4.%20Data%20Security)

### Kenya
>Data security was achieved through several methods including encryption, secure file transfer and authentication. The system used for data transmission from the mobile devices to the census servers employed industry-leading encryption mechanisms to ensure that data was always encrypted and secure while in transit. In addition, secure sockets layer (SSL) technology and strong encryption keys were implemented at the point of collection and transmission to the server.
> 
>To ensure the security of the mobile devices including the application and data, the following was implemented; the mobile devices were running on a tested up-to-date android operating system, there was a logon PIN/Password required to protect against unauthorized access to the device, MDM software was installed to track the devices in case of theft. The MDM had an application locking software to protect installed apps from being uninstalled and introduction of unauthorized apps. Lastly, the devices were protected with a screen protector and flip cover to provide shock protection in case of falls.
>
>To ensure data security, a Private Access Point Name (APN) was configured to ensure that the SIM Cards could only communicate to the Census servers.
>

### Sierra Leone
>For data security reasons, only accredited functionaries were allowed to use the App, the mapping PAD would periodically run system authentication on every phone the App is installed. The mapping PAD remote submission process utilized a top-level security cloud system to scan and safely deliver uploaded tasks to GIS portal. The GIS portal could only be opened by registered and verified GIS Officers.

### Botswana
>Statistics Botswana used fort iGATE firewall as the first layer of security to protect internal network from external untrusted traffic. They made sure that the antivirus for the organization is installed on all the servers including that of the Census for data protection. 
>
>Overall, the 2022 PHC had four end users with authorized access in the tablets, laptops, and desktops. In addition, each IT personnel was using their Passwords to log in to the servers.
