<blockquote>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>
<p>Many vehicles were used to facilitate implementation of all the census activities. The vehicles included the KNBS fleet and mobilized vehicles through hiring; borrowing from other government departments and ministries; use of alternative transport such as boats and motorbikes; and use of flights/helicopters in difficult terrain and insecure places. During actual enumeration stage, about 4,500 vehicles were used.  Fueling and maintenance of the vehicles during pilot cartographic mapping was done by transport section at the headquarters by allocation of specific fuel cards.  While during enumeration, fueling and maintenance was done at approved petrol stations and garages.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch of Various Materials</strong></p>
<p>During the pre-enumeration phase, the materials included: T-shirts, fliers, notebooks, field bags, identification badges, dustless chalks, felt pens, umbrellas, field boots, and tablets among others. These materials were issued to the team leaders centrally who in turn distributed to their team members. The publicity materials included brochures and posters. The recruitment materials included printed forms for recording applicant’s details, counter books that acted as a register for applicants. The training materials included manuals, notebooks, marker pens, pens, chalks, tablets, and power banks/solar chargers. The enumeration materials included tablets, bags, ID badges, power banks, solar chargers, torches with batteries, reflector jackets, and cards (structure numbering, call back and travelers). The census logistics team prepared and effected a delivery plan of the procured materials. The materials were either procured centrally at KNBS headquarters or at the counties. The team also developed issuance forms and guidelines on handling, storage, and issuance.<br>
<!-- -->The mobile devices were assembled by two local universities namely, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and Moi University. The mobile devices were delivered directly by the universities to the storage facilities in the counties. The tablets for use by ICT Supervisors were delivered directly to counties that had venues for the ICT Supervisors training. The other tablets and power banks/ solar chargers were distributed to the county storage facilities.</p>
<p>All counties had been guided to identify appropriate storage facilities at the county level. The Bureau requested and was granted use of storage containers from the Ministry of Energy. The containers were referred to as “Gas Yetu Containers” and were initially used by the Ministry to distribute LPG and were available up to sub county level. Other storage facilities included KNBS offices and county commissioner offices. Armed security, through Kenya Police Service, were deployed to guard the premises when census materials were within the counties.</p>
<p>Dispatch of the census materials was done using various modes. Lorries and canters from the National Youth Service and Special Programs department were used to ferry materials to various regions. Courier services were used to send materials which were urgently needed to the counties. Helicopters from the department of defense airlifted material to the far counties. At the county level, the CSOs with assistance of the county lead coordinators distributed materials to the personnel. Most of the materials were distributed at the various training centers where the ICT and content supervisors handled the distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieval of Census Materials</strong></p>
<p>Guidelines were developed on return of the census materials from the counties. The materials that census personnel were to return included tablets, power banks, solar chargers, maps, ID Badges, questionnaires, and notebooks. The enumerators submitted their materials to their content supervisors then the content supervisors submitted to the ICT supervisor who in turn returned to the CSO. The mobile devices (tablets, solar chargers, and power banks) were returned to main storage facility at KNBS headquarters. A delivery plan had the first devices received at the main storage facility on 9th September 2019 and the last county delivered on 2nd November 2019.  The returned devices had their details captured into an MS Access database to ease future retrievals.</p>
<p>The census logistics team was composed of one census coordinator and four logistics officers. The logistics officers were allocated specific counties. Up to 40 logistics casuals were engaged prior to census enumeration and were engaged up to the period when the devices had been received at the KNBS HQs storage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sub-committee of the census TWC was established to undertake financial management for the censuses. The committee was also charged with the responsibility of mobilizing resources from various stakeholders and development partners to support implementation of various census activities and processes. The mobilized resources which were 99% from the government, were managed centrally. Regulations were developed which were shared with officers that were advanced some funds to manage the payments at County Levels. KNBS had a bank account dedicated to census at the headquarters, through which all funds’ transactions were made. At the sub national level (County) Census Bank Accounts were opened to manage payments at that level. All receipts were acknowledged through the official receipting system and payments were supported by fully authorized documentation. All funds allocated to the Counties were remitted to the County Accounts as AIE, on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Several activities undertaken during the census process were facilitated through requests advanced to members of staff. Funds approval was done in an hierarchical manner - the user requests were first approved by the Director General who forwarded the same to the Director, Corporate Services for processing. Payments that were made through the county census bank accounts included allowances (of ICT supervisors, content supervisors and enumerators, county census committee members, sub-county committee members, village elders, security personnel), payments for training venues and storage of various materials, transporting personnel and materials, among others.</p>
<p>After the census was completed, approved accounting documents were forwarded back to the Finance office at Real Towers in Nairobi and to the County Accountants’ offices. These accounting documents consisted of signed payment schedules, attendance registers and meeting minutes to account for sitting allowances paid to sub-county committee members while planning for recruitment, undertaking shortlisting, interviews, and approving the list of successful candidates and contacting them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A procurement sub-committee was appointed one year before the census enumeration to handle all procurement activities. The team developed procurement guidelines in conformity with the current country Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act (PPADA, 2015) and the relevant regulations, which provided procurement and financial flow guidelines on various aspects of the 2019 KPHC procurement process.</p>
<p>Open tendering method was the main procurement method used during acquisition of the census materials and equipment. Procurement plans were prepared before each financial year and had to be approved by the Board before execution. The process adhered to the detailed approved 2019 KPHC procurement plan. All procurements of goods, equipment, and services for the 2019 KPHC was centrally handled at the headquarters as detailed by the Guidelines. However, in exceptional cases where the situation on the ground and logistical challenges dictated that a specific procurement could be undertaken at the County level. In such a scenario the procurement sub-committee advised accordingly to facilitate the activity and ensured that the process adheres to PPADA, 2015 guidelines.  At the sub-national level, the county census committees and sub-county census committees were established to oversee implementation of the procurement activities especially acquisition of training facilities and storage facilities.</p>
<p>Synergy existed between different census committees (procurement and technology data management sub-committees) and the procurement division, and user directorates that facilitated the smooth running of the process. There was good communication between the procurement division and the user directorate on item specifications/Terms of reference (TORs) to ensure that any deviations were detected early, and action taken. The user directorate provided adequate specifications/Terms of reference (TORs) as per the requirements to procurement section which ensured timely procurement. Procurement sub-committee meetings appraised the members with census materials requests before they are forwarded to the Director General for approval.</p>
<p>Secretariat scheduled meetings frequently (fortnightly) where status reports were provided and this enhanced monitoring of the procurement progress. A special census procurement file was opened for the purpose of checking and monitoring the status of procurement processes to enable proper documentation of all procurements.</p>
<p>Involvement and engagement of relevant stakeholders (Ministry of ICT and others) in the planning process especially in the acquisition of mobile devices addressed any possible challenges and risks that may hinder the performance of procurement activity. This minimized possible challenges and risks that might have hindered the performance of the procurement activity.</p>
