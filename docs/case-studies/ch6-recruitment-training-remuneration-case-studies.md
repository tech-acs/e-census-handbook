## Recruitment
[back to Handbook section](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-06/introduction#61-recruitment)
### Namibia
>Namibia used an e-recruitment system during implementation of pilot and main census enumeration. The NSO recruited enumerators, team supervisors and IT field technicians as per the planned field structure. The recruitment for the census pilot was mainly at constituency level and the most preferred people were those who live in the selected EAs and all the temporary census pilot positions were advertised externally i.e. on the NSA website, the Ministry of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment Creation’s website, in the local newspapers, on the Radio and on the noticeboards of the following places:  NSA Regional office, Regional council office, the Clinics, Schools, Police stations, Malls or Shopping centers. Any persons interested in applying for the various positions was encouraged to apply online via the Ministry of Labour, Industrial Relations, and Employment Creation’s website.
>
>One of the recruitment criteria was that applicants should have completed grade 12, which was a challenge for areas with low literacy rates. In addition, the following personal /biographical information of each applicant was considered as criteria for selection, namely educational qualifications, driver’s license, language proficiency, basic IT literacy and previous survey experience. Candidates were deployed within the same constituency of residence, because such persons are already familiar with the people, places, and customs in their respective communities.

### Kenya
>Kenya used a manual recruitment process, and a recruitment guideline was prepared to guide through the entire process. Prior to census enumeration, a job advertisement for enumerators, content supervisors and ICT Supervisors was published in the MyGov newspaper supplement of 11th June 2019 contained in all daily newspapers. The recruitment aimed to achieve a ratio of enumerators to content supervisors at five and for ICT supervisors at 50.
>
>The recruitment processes were carried out in the counties by the County Census Committees. The County Statistical Officers received applications for ICT Supervisors while Content Supervisors and Enumerators submitted their applications to the Chief’s Office and Assistant Chief’s office, respectively. After receiving the applications, the County Census recruitment committee used the qualifications as they were in the advert to shortlist. The number to be shortlisted was guided by the number of applicants and the positions to be filled. The committee ranked those who qualified based on the strength of their qualifications and the roles to be undertaken and the one third gender rule as required by law. At the point of application, details of the applicants were summarized using a standard form that was provided. The summary details included: Name of the applicant, Identification Number, Mobile Phone Number, Age, Sex, Disability Status, Ethnicity, Sub-County of Residence, Kenya Certificate of Secondary Grade, and Highest level of Education completed. The filled forms were submitted to the County Census Committees.
>
>To ensure uniformity in the recruitment, standard interview tests were developed and shared electronically with the County Census Committees in a password-protected document for integrity. The County Census Committee submitted the list of applicants shortlisted and selected candidates to the Director General for approval. The successful candidates were notified through public notice boards, phone calls and text messages.

### Botswana
>Botswana used e-recruitment for the 2022 PHC for enumerators and supervisor’s testing and selection. The recruitment aimed to achieve a ratio of enumerators to content supervisors at four. During the Pilot census, the assessment was done using google forms which required internet access for the whole period of writing up to submitting the test and instant receipt of test scores.
>
>For the main census, a team of system developers reviewed the assessment tool and developed it in CSPro software. The assessment was accessed through a CAPI system that was able to work offline but needed internet connection for synchronizing/submitting the assessment that was also backed up on tablets. The assessment was password protected and only made available when allowed and ready to take the test. All applicants taking the assessment were registered in the system by using their national identity card numbers (Omang). For those who were not Omang, the development team had to register them to access the test.

### Sierra Leone
>The recruitment procedures adopted for 2021 MTPHC followed a similar pattern of the past censuses in Sierra Leone. The recruitment aimed to achieve a ratio of enumerators to content supervisors at five and for ICT supervisors at 3,375.  Job advertisements were put out over the media for the various categories of field staff needed for the cartography mapping, pilot census and the main census enumeration. Ability to handle an electronic instrument (phone, iPad, laptop, desktop etc.) was an advantage in the recruitment process for the Mid Term Census cartography and census. Shortlisted candidates were interviewed, the successful candidates went through training and examinations to guide the selection of field staff. Extra persons were recruited to serve as a reserve in case of illness, bad performance or abandonment of positions. Contracts and picture IDs were provided to each successful participant at the end of training to aid field staff identification.

## Training
[back to Handbook section](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-06/6.2.%20Training#621-introduction)

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on census operations especially training and field work for countries that conducted the census in the same period. National statistical offices and census agencies collaborated with the relevant health authorities to enhance safety protocols to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The changes introduced included the fumigation of training facilities, the screening of participants, adherence to the recommended seating arrangement of two metres spacing between participants at training sessions, and body hygiene measures (handwashing and sanitizing). Because of the new activities to ensure compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, the training took longer and required more trainers, so the cost increased. 

Some countries trained their field staff purely online. Others had a hybrid training system in which enumerators would attend online, have pre-recorded training sessions at a common training centre with the involvement of data quality monitors, this was found to be better than a purely online system.

### Namibia
>
>Due to COVID-19 regulations issued by the government when the census pilot was conducted, the training of enumerators was done in small groups with numbers of less than 30 per class. There were three levels of trainings conducted during the census pilot namely, 
>-	Level 1: The master training was attended by around 20 qualified subject matter staff from the field operations, sampling, demographers, data processing and IT for a duration of 10 days in Windhoek. This training was facilitated by Managers and Executives from the subject matter area which included the census manager.
>-	 Level 2: The Training of Trainers (ToT) was attended by around 50 qualified subject matter Statisticians, Assistant Statisticians, regional Statisticians including the IT field technical staff for a duration of 10 days in Windhoek. This training was facilitated by all the staff that attended the master training. 
>-	Level 3: The main training for all field staff, this level of training was conducted at regional level. The highest number of trainees per classroom was 26 and the lowest was 12 and it proved to be well manageable. A total of 191 trainees were trained across the 14 regions and this level of training was facilitated all the staff that attended the ToT for a duration of 10 days.
>	
>Level 1 and 2 trainings were conducted back-to-back with no break in between, after level 2 was done a one-week break was taken for preparations and deployment for the main training. Daily training review sessions were conducted to discuss any unresolved issues during training with the aim of improving the quality of training.
 
### Kenya
>
>The training for the census enumeration personnel was implemented in a cascaded manner. The first training level was the Training of Trainers involving 500 participants in a central place. Thereafter, the Trainers trained the ICT supervisors at regional level. The ICT Supervisors then trained the Content Supervisors for 7 days. The trained census personnel were then deployed in their respective enumeration areas.
>
>Training of enumerators was conducted on a non-residential basis in schools and churches for most of the regions except arid and semi-arid areas in which they were residential. In the non-residential training venues, payments were made to cater for meals and stationery. Training of trainers and supervisors (ICT and Content supervisors) were non-residential. Training of Trainers was held from 15th to 22nd July, 2019, training of ICT supervisors was done from 25th to 1st August, 2019 while training of content supervisors and enumerators were conducted from 4th to 11th August and 14th to 20th August, 2019 respectively.

## Remuneration
[back to Handbook section](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-06/6.3.%20Remuneration#631-introduction)

### Namibia
>All payments for the census pilot were handled by the National Statistics Agency’s finance department with the advice from HR and field operations division. All temporally staff who were recruited under the census pilot were paid a daily wage rate, daily field allowance, daily training allowance, transport allowance for all field staff working in urban EAs as well as airtime allowance. All team supervisors who were collecting vehicles away from their duty stations were paid transport allowance.
>
>Payments of field allowances were made in two instalments - 50% was paid at the start of the field work and the remaining 50% was paid in the middle of the field work.  Airtime was paid with the monthly salary pro-rated or in full, depending on the employment contract start date. All legal deductions were made as prescribed by the law.  

### Kenya
>The census personnel were paid as per the approved 2019 KPHC rates. The rates were applied throughout the census period. The payments were made directly to personal bank accounts or mobile phone numbers. Statutory deductions were applicable. No cash payments were made except for the NGAOs during mapping and sensitization exercises.
