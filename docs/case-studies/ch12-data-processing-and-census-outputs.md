## Data Processing
[back to Handbook section](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-12/12.1.%20Data%20Processing)
### Kenya
>The data processing team embarked on the process of assessing the census enumeration coverage immediately after data collection. This process involved the harmonization of EA Geo-codes that had been shared during tablets’ assembly and those used during enumeration. There was need for confirmation that all the EAs created during the mapping exercise were accounted for (with or without data). The next step was extraction of data from tablets whose data did not reach the server by close of enumeration. This was followed by checking and confirming whether all the EAs had data both from pre-enumeration listing of households and enumeration data. A comparison of listed households and actual returns, and accounting for the variances was done.  In addition, a comparison of mapped households, listed households and actual enumerated households was also done and any discrepancies addressed.
>
>The next step was to check for data consistency at household and individual levels. Basic edit specifications were developed to check the inconsistencies. The purpose of editing was to ensure that the final dataset did not include training data (data that was collected during training of census personnel) as well as ineligible individuals (empty records). In addition, the editing process took the following into account:  households with missing household heads; individual records without age, sex, and relationship for conventional households; individual records without sex and age for non- conventional households; and duplicate records for structure, household numbers, and enumerator codes. Subsequently, tabulation plans were developed and used to generate summary tables for basic and analytical reports. Data in the generated tables was compared with existing data sets to assess the consistency of enumeration coverage and the outputs were validated by key stakeholders and thereafter launched.
>
>Census data editing: Kenya utilized the handbook on Population and Housing Census Editing to come up with the editing specifications for the different modules in the census; Census data editing Team: The editing team was composed of data processors, subject matter specialists (demographic and non-demographic), computer programmers, supervisors and managers; KNBS has the inhouse capacity to program the edit specifications and run them to generate clean data files; We also utilized experienced CSPro data processors (former KNBS staff) who helped in the programming of editing/ imputation codes. Analytical Reports:  Subject matter specialists drawn from the 2019 KPHC drafted the reports and then shared with the stakeholders for review; KNBS received TA support through the UNFPA ESARO office to come up with Population Projections report; Looking forward to receiving TA to come up with Geo-Spatial Dissemination System. Data Quality checks: An edit specification document should be prepared by the subject matter specialists and shared before pilot is undertaken; Hard checks in CAPI should be enforced for majority of the questions to reduce content errors.

### Kenya
>
> The process of producing the 2019 census products started with identification of a technical team drawn from the KPHC Technical Working Committee and those with experience from the 2009 census to lead the process.
>
> A concept note to undertake the development of outputs was developed and the required technical assistance was sourced from universities and MDAs, while the financial support was obtained from various development partners. During implementation of the process, mapping of the users and key stakeholders by thematic area/sector and formation of teams by thematic areas; Identifying the key indicators by thematic area taking into consideration both international, regional and national indicators; Development of tabulation plans per thematic area and report formats which were presented to the TWC for discussion and approval; and the team took lead in all the phases of production of census products.
>
> During development of the census products, the following steps were followed: 
> 1) Development of tabulation plans for various indicators; 
> 2) Generation of tables for the various indicators; 
> 3) Undertaking consistence checks based on the outputs from various tables; 
> 4) Review of the data edit specifications to address any noted inconsistencies;  
> 5) Generation of final tables from cleaned data set; 
> 6) Report writing and peer review of the reports; 
> 7) Editing and formatting of the reports; 
> 8) Validation of the reports through engagement of various stakeholders; 
> 9) Printing of the final report; 
> 10) Launch of the reports. 

### Eswatini
>
> Thematic reports and population projections reports were produced but the Launch of thematic reports was delayed by two years because there was a shortage of staff to undertake data cleaning. UNFPA provided a Census Technical Specialist who was stationed within the NSO, managed the production of census products. 
>
> The process of developing census products entailed; the involvement of subject area specialists from within and outside of government (NSO personnel including the GIS Unit, health, education, the UN and others); So far  they have produced a series of thematic reports packaged in 10 publications.
