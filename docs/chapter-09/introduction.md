# Introduction
In the recent past there has been an increased use of technology in both census and survey undertakings across Africa. During the 2020 PHC Round, several countries embraced the use of technology in the census business process. 

**Advantages of electronic data collection**
The UN guidelines on the use of electronic data collection technologies in population and housing censuses underscore that the use of technology is key in improving the cost, quality (coverage, accuracy, timeliness) and efficiency of a census process. Therefore, the uptake of technological innovations has provided new opportunities for increasing the quality and speed with which census data can be collected and processed. However, several countries in Africa have limited capacity for the use of new technologies and other innovations put in place to effectively and efficiently implement a digital PHC. 

Country representatives expressed their need for support from ECA on census technologies to improve their census processes, to which ECA offered based on the available innovations.   

This chapter identifies important lessons and, recommends ICT infrastructure and technological innovations based on experiences from selected African countries in the 2020 round of PHC.
