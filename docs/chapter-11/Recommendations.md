# Recommendations

The PES should be planned and budgeted for as an integral part of the census operations. A PES is unlikely to yield useful results if it is a last-minute addition only considered once the census operation has been completed. As such, unless the PES is properly planned and executed it is unlikely to yield value for money as the results may not be valid. Consider whether or not carrying out a PES is a good use of resource.

If it is intended to carry out a PES, then a pilot PES should also be conducted soon after the census pilot.
  This will enable any problems with the PES data collection, PES questionnaire etc to be resolved before the final PES enumeration.
A PES pilot will also provide data that can be matched to the census pilot data thereby allowing the automatic matching algorithms to be coded, tuned and tested for accuracy prior to the live census to PES matching operation. The clerical matching system can also be tested during this time and instructions for clerical matchers can be developed and tested.  

  It is therefore important that the pilot PES is carried out in a sample of EAs used for the pilot census so that the same persons are enumerated in both.

Reconciliation visits may not make a significant difference to the results of the PES analysis.
Therefore, countries should consider the possibility of only carrying out reconciliation in a sample of PES EAs only and should have a plan to use the results of the reconciliation.
