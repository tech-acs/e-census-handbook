# PES Enumeration

Nearly all the stages of census enumeration will also apply to PES enumeration (see [Enumeration](..chapter-10)). A short questionnaire, harmonized where appropriate with the census questionnaire should be designed. See link to example PES questionnaire if eg Rwanda will allow us to share.
  
It is important to collect information about who was a usual resident during the census, as well as about persons who are resident at the time of the PES. PES enumerators therefore need additional training to cover this part of the questionnaire. A CAPI application is generally used for the PES enumeration, but using a different set of devices is generally easier than trying to repurpose the census devices.

Most countries have recruited a new team of enumerators for the PES, rather than using census enumerators. Having a new team does ensure independence. However, it is possible to use the same enumerators for census and PES, so long as they work in different enumeration areas.
