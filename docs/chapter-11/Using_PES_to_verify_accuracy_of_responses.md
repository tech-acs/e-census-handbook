# Using PES to verify the accuracy of census responses

The PES questionnaire should be kept as simple as possible to reduce the respondent burden and keep the PES enumeration period short.
  Most of the questions asked on the PES questionnaire are to enable matching of the PES respondents to the census respondents. 
  However, a selection of census questions may also be included on the PES questionnaire for the purpose of analyzing the accuracy of the responses given during the census enumeration.
  

  Once the PES and census data has been matched, the responses for the selected questions can be compared to see if the same response was given during both census and PES enumeration. 
    
This will indicate how well the questions were understood and how accurately they were answered. mA large difference in answers may indicate that the questions were not well understood either by the enumerators or the respondents â€“ and that similar questions need to be rewritten and tested prior to any further surveys or census.
