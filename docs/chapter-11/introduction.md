# Introduction

A census post-enumeration survey (PES) is a survey carried out in a sample of EAs soon after the census enumeration has been completed. The main purpose of a PES is to assess the undercoverage of the census enumeration i.e., to estimate the number of people who have been missed from the census. However, the PES can also contribute to an assessment of census overcoverage i.e., people who have been counted in the census twice. The PES can also be used to verify the accuracy of responses for some key census questions. Even if census figures are not adjusted according to the result of the PES analysis, the estimates of the true population calculated should feed into population projections. Finally, lessons learned from the PES can inform the improved design of future censuses and surveys.

Countries should consider carefully whether or not it is a good use of time and resource to carry out a PES as part of their census operation. Whilst a well conducted PES will yield value insights into the quality of the census coverage and accuracy, it can be a time and money consuming exercise. If the results are not used because, for example, there is too much uncertainty in the estimates, then the time and money spent on the PES may have been better used elsewhere e.g., in improving the quality of the census coverage. If a PES is going to be conducted, then it should be planned and funded as an integral part of the census, and should not be carried out as an after thought or a tick-box exercise.
