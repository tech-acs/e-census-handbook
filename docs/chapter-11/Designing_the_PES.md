## 11.2 Designing the PES 

<p> When designing the PES, be clear about what you are trying to measure e.g., undercoverage estimates by region or at a national level? 
The PES sample size is dependent on the level of geography at which estimates are desired.  For example, to estimate the undercount at national level, requires a smaller sample size than to estimate the undercount at a regional level. A sample of Enumeration Areas (EAs) is selected ensuring that the sample is representative of the population including EAs from all parts of the country and a mixture of urban and rural geographies. The sample may be weighted to include proportionately more EAs that are considered hard to enumerate, since these EAs are likely to be more informative. 
The PES concentrates on persons and households only, so make sure that EAs selected for the PES do include residential properties and are not just made up of commercial or communal establishments such as hospitals or army camps. </p>

### 11.2.1 PES Enumeration

<p> Nearly all the stages of census enumeration will also apply to PES enumeration see [Enumeration](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/category/chapter-10-enumeration). A short questionnaire, harmonized where appropriate with the census questionnaire should be designed. </p>
  
<p> It is important to collect information about who was a usual resident during the census, as well as about persons who are resident at the time of the PES. PES enumerators therefore need additional training to cover this part of the questionnaire. A CAPI application is generally used for the PES enumeration, but using a different set of devices is generally easier than trying to repurpose the census devices. </p>

<p> Most countries have recruited a new team of enumerators for the PES, rather than using census enumerators. Having a new team does ensure independence. However, it is possible to use the same enumerators for census and PES, so long as they work in different enumeration areas. </p>
