# 1.3 Rationale

The e-handbook draws its content from experiences of National Statistical Offices (NSO), Pan-African Agencies and census experts supporting implementation of PHC in Africa during the 2020 Round of PHC. The information is provided voluntarily by the various stakeholders, reviewed, and published in the handbook for reference especially with the countries planning to undertake a PHC and informing planning for the 2030 Round of PHC in Africa. It is a ‘living’ document – to be updated as more NSOs undertake censuses, evaluate, and identify new lessons/experiences and approaches. It will grow to accommodate new experiences and lessons as countries undertake and evaluate their censuses.
