The use of technology in a census undertaking includes the use of innovative ways such as cloud computing, smart mobile devices, GPS, web GIS among others. During the 2020 Round, various technological innovations were done with the aim of improving the quality of census processes and efficiency of the census business model. Amongst the innovations done the following were offered by ECA: provisioning of tablets, the use of census and survey monitoring dashboard, Census support center/Issue tracker, among others. 

Efforts have been made to ensure that the tools available to support digital census are affordable and readily accessed. For instance, all the UNECA census tools are made with open-source technology and are completely free to use by member states.

### 9.2.1 Provisioning of Tablets
Census tablet provisioning is basically “getting the tablets from factory state to enumeration readiness”. It involves loading each tablet with all the necessary resources that it requires to be used by enumerators to collect and transmit data from the field. The resources to upload on the tablets include mobile apps required for the enumeration (such as CSEntry), data files (such as questionnaires, user manuals, navigable maps). Resources such as maps are specific to an area, each tablet might have to receive different maps.

To help with the distribution of customized data to each tablet, consider first assigning unique identifiers to each tablet then use those on a computer system to “assign” each tablet to a respective area (Enumeration Area). The provisioning process would then have to look up assignments and deploy the respective payload for each tablet. 

UNECA developed an end-to-end provisioning system which is made up of a back-end system, mobile apps for copying data and quality control, and a tablet decommissioning system that will reset all tablets to factory state once the census exercise is over. This technology has been used in various countries like: Egypt, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Seychelles, Zimbabwe, and Mauritius. 
The provisioning process can be summarized and demonstrated as shown in figure 9.1 below.

Advantages of automated provisioning
-	Minimizes possible human error that would arise from doing this manually in a monotonous manner. 
-	Saves on financial and human resource costs, the system for provisioning of tablets works over Wi-Fi and requires little human intervention. 
-	Capability of provisioning multiple tablets at once thereby cutting down on the time it takes to get the tablets ready.

According to Android version installed on devices, there are alternate methods of provisioning devices such as by directly connecting multiple devices to computers/laptops via USB ports and then using UNECA’s provisioning script to “send” the requisite files to the respective devices.
This method, in general, will take more time and perhaps more resources (in the form of computers) but also requires less infrastructure setup and is also the only alternative for devices running Android version greater than 10.

In general, key considerations in device provisioning should be to think through what needs to happen to the devices to make them ready for field work. Usually, this will include but is not limited to, installing the CAPI and its runner application, loading the assigned EA maps, loading instruction manuals (usually pdfs) on CAPI and device use installing required applications such as map viewer/navigator, pdf reader, etc. 

#### 9.2.1.1 Selected Country experience
Countries that conducted a digital census in the 2020 round used automated provisioning of tablets. It is noted that Kenya simplified it further to work without full time internet connectivity while Botswana used an alternative to ECA app with enhanced security features. Below are some country experiences with provisioning of tablets:

**Kenya**
>The provisioning process was highly automated and required minimal human interaction. A network was set up to connect all the various hardware together so that the provisioning process can take place in a scalable and reliable manner. The network was relatively simple and self-contained and did not require Internet connectivity. After provisioning of the tablets, quality assurance was done to check if the provisioned tablets were ready for enumeration in the field again this was highly automated and required minimal human interaction such as pressing the volume button. 

**Botswana**
>The Manage Engine Mobile Device Manager plus App (MDM) was used to remotely manage the devices. It included features like device enrolment, App Management, Remote Troubleshooting, device security, location tracking and Audit Reports. It also helps in wiping the data in case the device is stolen or lost. A standard MDM tool can also track inventory of devices and perform real-time monitoring and reporting. A virtual server for MDM system was created. To allow for troubleshooting in the field, all Statistics Botswana IT Officers were given rights to log in to the system with their Domain Credentials to create Zoho account and use Zoho Assist.

#### 9.2.1.2 Lessons Learnt

The need to have a high-speed bandwidth considering that multiple tablets (as many as 200) were connecting to the network simultaneously and each one was downloading files of considerable size. Kenya suggested to use devices that support a bandwidth of 10Gbps to achieve an overall speed of 10Gbps bandwidth throughout the network.

#### 9.2.1.3 Recommendations

1.	Countries are encouraged to use a high-speed bandwidth that is not internet dependent considering that multiple tablets are connected to the network simultaneously during provisioning of tablets to minimize costs as was the case in Kenya.
2.	The mobile device management software should be procured well on time to avoid last-minute device enrollment because without device enrolment, it is not possible to manage or install Apps in the devices and this delays the entire process.
3.	Unique identification for the tablets should be based on geocodes. This is key because batching of tablets should be done down to the sublocation level for easy tracking and allocation as was the case in Kenya and Botswana. 

### 9.2.2 Census and Survey Dashboard

Census and survey dashboards are graphical tools that provide an overview of both the data and the process of data collection. The indicators monitored might include aggregate census data or data about the data collection process such as the number of submitted cases, outlier cases, etc. When used in conjunction with target and/or expected values, it can easily identify problem areas. It is helpful because it allows us to easily spot any anomalies in both the data and the process and to remedy them in time.

In the 2020 round of PHCs, the use of census and survey monitoring dashboards registered increased acceptance and were extensively used by census managers to monitor data collection progress and coverage in real-time during the enumeration process and post-enumeration survey. Since the dashboard is highly coupled with the census questionnaire, it must be designed and decided upon ahead of time by selecting “important” indicators that need to be monitored during the census. 

UNECA developed a robust census and survey monitoring dashboard. The following countries were supported to use the dashboard: Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Seychelles, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Ghana, Mauritius, Zambia, and Nigeria.

**Key features of the census monitoring dashboard**
-	It is designed to work with any census questionnaire database.
-	It is easy to deploy and requires only read-only access to the census database.
-	The indicators to be monitored have increased daily and vary from country to country. Indicators may provide insights on coverage, data quality and operational metadata including but not limited to enumerated number of households, enumerated population, Total Fertility Rate, population distribution, population pyramid, average interview time, etc. 
-	The dashboard presents these indicators using the most intuitive visualizations, such as charts, infographics, maps, and tables. These components are designed to convey summarized information at different levels of geographic area. 
-	Users have options to view indicators at the national level or drill down to the geographic area to zoom in for a narrow geographic coverage for more focused information.  
-	For selected indicators, the dashboard captures target and/or expected values to compare with the actual census performance. 
-	The dashboard is also equipped with a multi-language feature, currently working in English and French, with the language framework already implemented to include local languages if the requirements arise. 
-	A role-based access scheme is implemented in the dashboard, which allows system administrators to define roles with privileges and assign them to system users. Different user groups can access only those indicators of interest instead of overloading users with all the available indicators. 
-	Users can also be restricted from viewing information filtered to selected geographic areas per the countries' specific requirements.   

#### 9.2.2.1 Lessons Learnt 

1.	Considerations should be taken especially on who accesses the dashboard information and technical capacity should be built to avoid misinterpretation. 
2.	Most countries had a challenge of having a thin team of programmers, system administrators and technical support team who got overwhelmed during the enumeration process. This can lead to compromising on some of the quality assurance steps. 

#### 9.2.2.2 Recommendations

1.	The use of a daily monitoring dashboard for census implementation progress is very important and makes possible important communications and changes to avoid and mitigate errors in data as evidenced from Kenya and Sierra Leone.
2.	It is important to provide the monitoring dashboard at the time of training of field staff so that its essence is made known at that stage. As a result, the data collecting exercise will function better. When field staff are aware that their performance is continually evaluated in relation to targets. Every member of the field crew must be familiar with how the system works and how coverage is monitored as was the case in Sierra Leone. 
3.	A dedicated team constituting programmers (data managers), headquarter ICT support, Demographers and other subject-matter specialists should be stationed to undertake the following duties; Monitor quality of data as it streams in, run programs to detect and resolve any inconsistencies in the data, coordinate technical assistance for all field teams, prepare technical briefs for the census coordination office, backup data and provide feedback to the field teams in time as was the case in Kenya.

### 9.2.3 Census support center

Given that a census exercise runs into various logistical and technical issues,  it is very important to have in place a system of handling and resolving these issues ahead of time. A support center, staffed with knowledgeable operators and the right information at their fingertips will ensure that the exercise is able to resolve arising issues on time and easily. Common challenges include but are not limited to: Inconsistent support provided to field agents; lack of prioritization of issues; lack of mechanisms for self-help; untimely response, etc.

UNECA developed a support center system (with a backend system and a field agent app) that is easily customizable and deployable and integrated with the UNECA tablet provisioning system to help address the challenges highlighted above. The application comes with a dashboard to monitor Issue resolution for management. The flow of the issues can be summarized as shown below:

**Figure 9.2: Flow of census support Centre**

source: ECA

This application has been used in the following countries with successful and encouraging feedback: Botswana, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, ...

#### 9.2.3.1 Lessons Learnt
1.	Botswana had no clear work cycle that systematically shows the flow and management of issues during enumeration, the issues coming though were resolved by either GPS specialist, IT System Support or Census Technical Officers and there was no mechanism to tell whether an issue had been closed or not.

#### 9.2.3.2 Recommendations
1.	As was the case in Kenya, setting up a support center should be at the headquarters of the census implementing agency. The following should be put into considerations: the number of personnel operating in the support center and their training on the questionnaire content.  Possession of call center and ICT skills should be a pre-requisite for personnel to be recruited. Provision of efficient support center equipment such as laptops, phones, desks, and seats.  

2.	A census call center should have a clear work cycle with an ICT incident Management System whereby problems and inquiries are received from the enumerator or supervisor during enumeration and the call Centre Agent sends the case to field or headquarters technical support team and an update should be provided as to whether the case has been resolved.

### 9.2.4 Field Management Tool (Issue tracker)

The Census Field Management is a digital solution developed to address common challenges encountered during census, such as inconsistent support to enumerators at the field, difficulty to prioritize issues, lack of self-help, and slow response to challenges faced during data collections.   It consists of two key applications, a mobile application used by the enumerator and supervisor and a web application for support providers, typically stationed at the central or regional offices. The adoption of this tool by countries has shown an impact including improved data accuracy and efficiency, reduced time required to resolve issues, and enhanced collaboration and communication between field enumerators and support providers.
The digital solution is developed to improve the census process by providing a centralized platform for managing and tracking issues reported by field enumerators. This system is composed of two applications:
-	A mobile application installed on the data collection tablets and a web application for support providers. It enables field enumerators to request help, access self-help resources, and communicate with support providers through messaging and notification options.
-	A web application that provides a platform for support providers to manage and track issues, collaborate with each other, and access additional data such as agent/device history and logs.
The Census field management tool offers various features that improve the efficiency and accuracy of the census process. These features include:
•	Standardized workflow, 
•	Communication tools,
•	Integrations with other systems, 
•	Self-help
•	Prioritization
•	Customizable options for both the mobile and web applications.
The standardized workflow ensures consistent support to enumerator and supervisors, while data provided from the mobile application enables support providers to diagnose and resolve issues more quickly. In addition, the tools include messaging and notification options, improve collaboration and communication between enumerators and support providers. Finally, the system is integrated with other systems, such as the census operation monitoring dashboard for tracking status and providing insight issues resolution time during census.

The field management for census has been adopted by Zimbabwe being the first country to use it. Other countries that have identified the benefits of the tool and have either started using it on pilot or are in the process of customizing it including Namibia, Uganda, Benin, and Burundi. The customizable nature of the tool allows it to be adapted to the specific needs and requirements of each country, making it a flexible and scalable solution for census processes globally.

The adoption of the census field management has created a significant impact on the census process. It has improved efficiency by providing a centralized platform for managing and tracking issues reported on the field. The tool has also reduced the time required to resolve issues, enhancing the efficiency of support providers. Moreover, it has improved collaboration and communication between field agents and support providers, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly, and enumerator and supervisors feel supported throughout the census process.

The most frequently used features of the issues tracker include the self-help function, the messaging and notification options. The self-help function allows enumerators to search for solutions to common issues on their own, reducing the burden on the support team. The messaging and notification options allow for real-time communication between the enumerators and the support team, ensuring that issues are addressed in a timely manner. Finally, the data integrations provide support providers with additional context and history about the enumerators and supervisors and their devices, helping them to better understand and resolve issues.

In conclusion, the census field management tool (issues tracker) was a valuable addition to ECA’s support to countries. This tool impacts an area that is often not addressed yet critical to census taking. As many digital tools it is evolving and addressing key areas of country needs.
