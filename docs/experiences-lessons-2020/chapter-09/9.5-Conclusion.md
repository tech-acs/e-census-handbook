The use of electronic devices and other technologies impact on the Census business model in positive manner by ensuring timeliness in quality data collection. The UNSD in its report on the results from the survey of 2020 round population and housing censuses presented at the 51st session of the statistical commission in 2020 expected that the trend of using electronic data collection methods would significantly improve census coverage and the quality and timeliness of census results. Furthermore, the use of such technologies facilitates the collection of geographical information, thereby allowing the linkage of census data with location information and the production of geo-referenced census data.

The following areas of expertise can potentially be called upon in future to provide technical assistance to African countries as part of their census development. Such as provisioning of tablets and development of a comprehensive ICT census strategy from Kenyaâ€™s experience.

The following key areas have been identified to require work at the regional level to support and inform planning for the 2030 African Round of PHC and subsequently the implementation of censuses in African Countries: UNECA to support setting up the tablet provisioning tool, census monitoring dashboard, field management tool, PES matching tool, and census data dissemination platform, all packaged as suite of census applications. UNECA is currently considering supporting the overall census operation with a project management platform as another area of focus.
