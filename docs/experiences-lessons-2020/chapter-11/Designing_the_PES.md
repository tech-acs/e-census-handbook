## 11.2 Designing the PES 

<p> When designing the PES, be clear about what you are trying to measure e.g., undercoverage estimates by region or at a national level? 
The PES sample size is dependent on the level of geography at which estimates are desired.  For example, to estimate the undercount at national level, requires a smaller sample size than to estimate the undercount at a regional level. A sample of Enumeration Areas (EAs) is selected ensuring that the sample is representative of the population including EAs from all parts of the country and a mixture of urban and rural geographies. The sample may be weighted to include proportionately more EAs that are considered hard to enumerate, since these EAs are likely to be more informative. 
The PES concentrates on persons and households only, so make sure that EAs selected for the PES do include residential properties and are not just made up of commercial or communal establishments such as hospitals or army camps. </p>

### 11.2.1 Using PES to verify the accuracy of census responses

<p> The PES questionnaire should be kept as simple as possible to reduce the respondent burden and keep the PES enumeration period short.
  Most of the questions asked on the PES questionnaire are to enable matching of the PES respondents to the census respondents. 
  However, a selection of census questions may also be included on the PES questionnaire for the purpose of analyzing the accuracy of the responses given during the census enumeration.</p>
  
 <p> Once the PES and census data has been matched, the responses for the selected questions can be compared to see if the same response was given during both census and PES enumeration.  
This will indicate how well the questions were understood and how accurately they were answered. mA large difference in answers may indicate that the questions were not well understood either by the enumerators or the respondents â€“ and that similar questions need to be rewritten and tested prior to any further surveys or census.</p>

### 11.2.2 Dissemination and Reporting of PES

<p> A description of the PES methodology and the results of the PES analysis should be published so that users of the census data understand the limitations in the census results and can adjust accordingly. For example, see [Thematic Report: Post Enumeration Survey (https://www.statistics.gov.rw/publication/thematic-report-post-enumeration-survey) which has been published on the NISR website. </p>
