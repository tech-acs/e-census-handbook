## 11.5 Reconciliation

<p>After matching has been completed, most countries conducted reconciliation visits to the PES EAs to verify the status of unmatched persons. E.g., to verify whether an unmatched census resident was a usual resident at the PES EA at the time of the census, 
and is so, why they were not enumerated during the PES. The results of reconciliation tend not to change the results of the dual system estimation by any significant amount. However, the results of the reconciliation visits can be used to help understand any errors
in the data collection process (for both census and PES) and therefore to make improvements for future surveys.   It should be considered whether carrying out reconciliation visits in all PES EAs is a good use of time and money.</p>
