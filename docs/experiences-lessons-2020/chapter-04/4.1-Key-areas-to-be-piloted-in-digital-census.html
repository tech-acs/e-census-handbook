Key areas to be piloted in digital census.</h1></header><p><strong>A) Quality of Enumeration Area maps.</strong> EAs maps should be digitized and produced with the ideal measure of size (MOS) usually 80–150 households. The pilot therefore tests the completeness and accuracy of the EA maps especially boundaries, integration of the maps with the CAPI application, inclusion of accurate structure identifiers and addresses. Additionally, this helps to address challenges of using low resolution maps on tablets that are not sufficient to allow for resizing and zooming without alteration by enumerators. Testing the quality of EA maps at the same time informs the finalization of the tablet specifications to handle all aspects of the digital census. See more about <a href="https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/chapter-03/3.2-Pilot-mapping#32-pilot-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pilot mapping</a></p>
<p><strong>B) Efficiency of Device Preparation.</strong> The pilot census should test the equipment preparedness to ensure efficiency in blocking the unnecessary applications and Web sites (e.g., entertainment); prevention of supervisors and enumerators from installing applications; administrator access to bypass user-created passwords. As well as testing the correct use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on all tablets; battery timeout vis-a-vis the specifications.  In case the tablet battery timeout is not satisfactory, NSOs should make provisions for frequent charging in the field (e.g., power banks, battery packs or solar chargers). This key area also includes testing the readiness and adequacy of the census data centre and related IT infrastructure like servers to ensure data security.</p>
<p><strong>C) Effectiveness of CAPI data collection application, data transfer mechanisms, data processing.</strong> The pilot census can be used to test the final questionnaire in the way that it should be implemented on the devices for consistency in the flow of the questions, skip patterns, proper implementation of changes from the pretests etc. In terms of data transfer, focus is put on connectivity and communication issues to test the internet network infrastructure and ensure that interviewers and supervisors are familiar with data transfer procedures. This evaluation area is also aimed to ensure that all supervisors can provide the necessary support to their teams in the event of a technical failure in the field. For data processing, test the data coding, tabulation and analysis plans using the data collected from the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>D) Evaluate the data quality monitoring system and dashboard.</strong> A digital census utilizes electronic data quality assurance and monitoring mechanisms; therefore, the pilot census should test and evaluate their effectiveness. If the census monitoring dashboard is to be used, it needs to be in place and tested during the pilot. The quality assurance mechanisms should also be tested for example, the supervisors’ re-interview module, field observations/monitoring mechanisms.See more about the <a href="https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/chapter-09/9.2-Technological-Innovations#922-census-and-survey-dashboardhttps://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/chapter-09/9.2-Technological-Innovations#922-census-and-survey-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">census monitoring dashboard</a></p>
<p><strong>E) Census methodology and field operations.</strong> The pilot census should test the overall census methodology (including a census night and enumeration reference period). During the pilot census, an assessment of the adequacy of the planned duration of enumeration is done to ensure that adequate number of days are set aside for the exercise. There should be an assessment of the average duration that enumerators take to administer questionnaires to the different kinds of households and EAs to estimate the enumeration period, required human and financial resources.  Field operations to assess may include EA opening and closing , interactions between the supervisors and enumerators, engagement with the local administration, effectiveness of the publicity and advocacy activities. If a post-enumeration survey (PES) is planned as part of the census methodology, then a pilot PES should also be carried out. See more about <a href="https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/chapter-11/introduction#110-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PES</a></p>
<p><strong>F) Adequacy of recruitment and training approach.</strong> It is critical to evaluate the caliber of personnel recruited to implement a digital census and the recruitment criteria must be piloted to avoid compromising data quality during enumeration. The pilot census should test and evaluate the recruitment approach to be deployed, the performance of the recruited personnel by cadre, the effectiveness of the training approach and adequacy of the training agenda. In addition, assess training venues on availability of IT infrastructure including adequate audio, video, and non-electronic tools (e.g., furniture) to facilitate presentation.</p>
<p><strong>G) Evaluate the overall census administrative, financial, and other general logistics structure.</strong> This entails an assessment of the various administrative structures like flow of information, transport arrangements, packaging of the census tools and equipment (tablets), issuance of the tablets and collection mechanisms, warehousing, flow and management of funds, documentation of the field processes, replacement of tablets. This should also include an assessment of the risk mitigation strategy and updating it based on the evaluation of the pilot census findings as well as preparedness of regional offices for contingencies such as power outages, theft, or damage of IT equipment, procurement and other logistics like transport and storage.</p>

<p>The pilot census provides an opportunity to perfect the census preparedness ranging from administrative, logistical, technical, and technological infrastructure as well as revise the costing estimates. To obtain accurate costing estimates from the pilot, all the aspects of the census need to be finalized at this stage after testing.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of a digital census pilot</strong>
Lastly there are some limitations in a pilot digital census,  given the significantly smaller volume of data and field staff being used.  This needs to be borne in mind when evaluating the pilot and noting that small problems, although dealt with quickly in a pilot, may be significantly more troublesome in the main event.  Additionally, there should be plans after the pilot and before the main operations to stress test the ICT systems with realistic volumes of (artificial) data.</p>

<p>All Africa countries that undertook a digital census in the 2020 round of PHC conducted a pilot census including multiple testing exercises. It is noted that the pilot helped countries to revise their initial census plans especially with regards to recruitment criteria, training agenda, publicity and advocacy strategy, selection of trainers, adjustment of the questionnaires and data collection application among others.</p>
<p>Additionally, in as much it is recommended that pilot censuses should be conducted exactly a year to the actual census, some countries were not able to meet these timelines due to COVID-19, delay in approval of budgets, inadequate funding, among others. Below are some highlights of selected countries experiences:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kenya">Kenya<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kenya" title="Direct link to Kenya" href="/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-04/4.1-Key-areas-to-be-piloted-in-digital-census#kenya">​</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Kenya conducted several field tests before the pilot census to test the content and flow of the questionnaires as well as consistency checks and skip patterns. The pilot census was conducted exactly a year to the census date, thereafter, two pre-tests were undertaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first pretest aimed to: test the census data collection; assess the suitability of the uploaded Enumeration Area (EA) maps; test the pre-enumeration household listing; and test the flow of the questionnaire with the newly added questions that were not tested during pilot census.</li>
<li>The second pre-test aimed to test the recommendations made from the first pre-test regarding data collection application, uploaded EA maps, pre-enumeration household listing system as well as test the supervisor module that had not been included in the pilot census.
Pilot census and testing activities were carried out in purposively selected areas to include: densely populated rural and urban areas; urban slums; high class residential areas in urban setting; border counties with Internet connectivity issues; outdoor sleepers; travelers; hotels and lodges; rough terrain (hilly areas); areas with arid and semi-arid land; plantation regions; sparsely populated rural area; and Nomads/ Pastoralists community.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Ethiopia conducted three pilot censuses in November 2016, March 2017 and June 2018 but the main census enumeration has not yet taken place in 2020 round. The first and second pilots were conducted to test both enumeration methods: paper and tablet while the third one was purely digital with backup paper questionnaires for emergencies such as tablet failure and power shortage. After the completion of the first pilot lessons have been documented to inform subsequent census activities as outlined in this document.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Namibia conducted the Census Pilot Enumeration in September to October 2021 that provided important information on the adequacy of the field organization, supervisory areas, training program, extent of respondent burden, the data processing plan and other important aspects of the census that would better inform the actual census. Prior to the census pilot implementation, tests were done, and the data generated was used to review the batch editing program and test the monitoring dashboard.
The sampling design was purposive and included: special populations such as the Nomadic people in Opuwo that are based in Kunene region and Tsumkwe, holiday homes in Walvis/Swakop (coastal areas of Namibia); EAs in: commercial farms, resettlement farms, gated communities, communal settlements and urban (high class society, middle class, low/informal).</p>

<p>Some countries had not factored in budgets for carrying out several tests and this led to constraints of resources and scaling down of the tests. It is advisable that during planning, tests need to be allocated adequate resources as they are key in implementation of a digital census.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kenya-1">Kenya<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kenya" title="Direct link to Kenya" href="/e-census-handbook/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-04/4.1-Key-areas-to-be-piloted-in-digital-census#kenya-1">​</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Within the resources budgeted for the pilot census, two extra pretests had to be undertaken after the pilot census because it was not comprehensive enough to include testing of the supervisor module, additionally, the questionnaire was not yet final given that the NSO was still accepting to take on new questions.</li>
<li>The pilot census revealed several issues that informed the main census such as during the training, it was noted that time allocated for training on disability, labour, definition of concepts and map reading was not adequate, and this helped in revision of the training programme for the main census, among others.</li>
<li>This finding shows that the lessons from the pretests done before the pilot were not taken into consideration, for instance, the need to adjust the training timetable should have been seen and handled earlier during the pretests so that the pilot only identifies major issues. Such as the failure rate of the tablets that was used to decide on the number of spare tablets to allocate per supervisory area and the emergence of fake job advertisements that informed the change in recruitment strategy for the main census.</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recruitment guidelines were not followed leading to appointment of fieldworkers who were physically unfit, some were not familiar with digital technology while, others could not speak the local language, this negatively affected the pilot census operations. This was coupled with lack or poor communication about field worker entitlements that led to discontent and disruption of the training.</li>
<li>The pilot census was done before a thorough review and finalization of the data collection tools was completed, pretests should have been done earlier to address issues found such as inconsistencies in the translated questionnaires, inappropriate and non-functional skip patterns/rules in the data capture application.</li>
<li>The pilot census led to an overhaul in some of the IT equipment specifications indicating that there may have been limited prior research or non-adherence to recommendations. This lesson is drawn from the failure of power banks to charge the mobile devices due to low capacity, low battery time for the tablets, poor network coverage that necessitated modification of the specifications for the equipment hence a fresh budget.</li>
<li>Lack of preparedness on the part of the trainers and field operations office to ensure availability of appropriate training centres with LCD projectors to present video lessons affected the training in some centres and this can compromise on the data quality. This therefore necessitated the inclusion of specifications for an ideal training centre for a digital census as part of the training plan.</li>

<p>Based on the selected country experiences and the lessons learned during implementation of a digital pilot census, the following recommendations are made to inform future PHCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adequate budgeting and resourcing for a pilot census and other testing activities should be taken into consideration to avoid budgetary constraints as was the case in Kenya that budgeted for one pilot exercise. There is a need to provide adequate resources to undertake the pilot census, questionnaire pretests and the subsequent post pilot testing exercises. Effective planning and resourcing for the pilot and pretests needs to be carefully done as this is normally overlooked during the planning process. See more on <a href="https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/chapter-02/2.2-Development-of-census-budget-and-workplan#22development-of-census-budget-and-workplan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budgeting</a></li>
<li>The purposively selected EAs for the pilot census should be exhaustive within the country’s context as was the case in Kenya, Namibia.</li>
<li>Prior to the census pilot implementation, all digital data collection tools including all application menus should be tested and the data generated should be used to make reviews such as on the batch editing program, the monitoring dashboard etc. Avoid conducting a pilot census when all is not set including the questionnaire content.</li>
<li>It is important to ensure that all the aspects of the digital PHC are tested before the actual census. After each modification, a test should be done to ensure that the updated data capture and monitoring system is working properly.</li>
<li>Staff recruitment and training procedures should be prepared in advance and be part of the pilot census test, they should also take language issues and renumeration into account.  It is ideal to recruit enumerators from within or around the EAs to avoid the experience of Ethiopia. However, the pilot experience enabled strict adherence to the recruitment guidelines for the main PHC to ensure appropriate personnel are recruited. It is important to place the advert for fieldworkers in media communications at least 2 to 3 months prior to the recruitment period, to allow enough time for verification process i.e., whether field staff meet the necessary requirements for recruitment etc. (Namibia). Countries also recommended that an independent e-recruitment system customized to the recruitment needs of the agency may be used.</li>
