# 10 Introduction  

The enumeration phase is among the most important stages  for a population and housing census that happens after years of preparatory activities. The main objective of enumeration is to ensure that all individuals are covered and enumerated only once to achieve a proper description of the total population of a country and its geographical distribution within the country. 

Census enumeration is conducted on either a de facto or de jure basis based on a specific reference date. The enumeration takes place over a varying period of days across the various countries. The enumeration days range from one to two weeks depending on several factors. A period of one additional week may be considered, in cases where unexpected challenges or difficulties are encountered during the field enumeration exercise. A census relies on successful enumeration within a strict time-bound period.

This chapter points out selected country experiences, lessons learned and recommends on what should be done during a digital census enumeration. It focuses on the areas of pre-enumeration listing of households, EA identification, data collection and data quality assurance. 

**Enumeration during the non-digital vs digital era**
In the digital era, the traditional method of enumerating the population through face-to-face interviews is done using handheld devices to automatically capture and transmit the data as opposed to using a paper questionnaire. On the other hand , the self-enumeration method can now be applied using the Internet. This saves on the data management time as there  are fewer errors and omissions in the data. 

Nevertheless, the support of technology introduces the potential for one central disaster having an impact across the whole enumeration process, which is more devastating than in the non-digital census, where failures are more likely to have localized impacts. In addition, the failure of a significant part of the technology close to census day such as the central server can have a more serious impact and therefore a lot more preparation and testing is required compared to the non-digital census.

**Considerations for digital census enumeration**

Below is an outline of considerations that should be made in planning for and implementing the actual census enumeration, it is not exhaustive but has been aimed at by several countries:
-	Countries should develop appropriate enumeration procedures that will ensure that full coverage of the population is attained, within the predetermined budget and set timelines as well as maximize efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

-	The census enumeration should aim to achieve the highest response rates and good data quality, therefore good publicity should continue during this phase and emphasis the benefit of the census to the community and confidentiality and privacy. Ensure local leaders are involved in the enumeration and that they cooperate with the NSO to assist in community acceptance of the census. As well as ensure the safety of the enumerators and their data collection gadgets.

-	The enumeration procedures should give a clear description of the place of enumeration â€“ this can be the place where the person is present or place of usual residence. There should be clear instructions to the enumerators about all possible cases that may create confusion when identifying the place of enumeration. This is to ensure that every individual has only one place of enumeration and avoid double counting.

-	There should be guidelines in place to explain who will be included in or excluded from the enumeration in a prevailing circumstance.

-	There should be a clear criteria and instruction for enumerating various population groups especially the non-household population. Where there are special population groups identified for special enumeration, there should be special strategies devised and procedures in place to ensure their inclusion in the census. Such as migrants, nomads, defense forces and persons in restricted areas, homeless persons, diplomats etc. as detailed in the census management handbook.

-	The enumeration exercise should observe the fundamental principles of official statistics, specifically ensure confidentiality of census data among the enumerators.

-	There should be a provision to document the experiences including lessons learnt to inform the next round of census as well as address the major gaps that occurred in the previous census enumeration to ensure a relatively higher coverage rate.

-	Finally, there should a mechanism to ensure that the census enumeration procedures are complied with and are consistent across all the regions of the country.
