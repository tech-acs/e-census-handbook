# Chapter 04: Pretest and Pilot Census - Recommendations
[back to Handbook Chapter 4](/docs/category/chapter-04-pretest-and-pilot-census)

1. Adequate budgeting and resourcing for a pilot census and other testing activities should be taken into consideration to avoid budgetary constraints as was the case in Kenya that budgeted for one pilot exercise. There is a need to provide adequate resources to undertake the pilot census, questionnaire pretests and the subsequent post pilot testing exercises. Effective planning and resourcing for the pilot and pretests needs to be carefully done as this is normally overlooked during the planning process. See more on [budgeting](/docs/experiences-lessons-2020/chapter-02/2.2-development-of-census-budget-and-workplan)
2. The purposively selected EAs for the pilot census should be exhaustive within the countryâ€™s context as was the case in Kenya, Namibia. 
3. Prior to the census pilot implementation, all digital data collection tools including all application menus should be tested and the data generated should be used to make reviews such as on the batch editing program, the monitoring dashboard etc. Avoid conducting a pilot census when all is not set including the questionnaire content.
4. It is important to ensure that all the aspects of the digital PHC are tested before the actual census. After each modification, a test should be done to ensure that the updated data capture and monitoring system is working properly. 
5. Staff recruitment and training procedures should be prepared in advance and be part of the pilot census test, they should also take language issues and renumeration into account.  It is ideal to recruit enumerators from within or around the EAs to avoid the experience of Ethiopia. However, the pilot experience enabled strict adherence to the recruitment guidelines for the main PHC to ensure appropriate personnel are recruited. It is important to place the advert for fieldworkers in media communications at least 2 to 3 months prior to the recruitment period, to allow enough time for verification process i.e., whether field staff meet the necessary requirements for recruitment etc. (Namibia). Countries also recommended that an independent e-recruitment system customized to the recruitment needs of the agency may be used.
