# Chapter 08: Census Communications - Publicity, Advocacy and Dissemination - Recommendations
[back to handbook Chapter 8](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/category/chapter-08-census-communication--publicity-advocacy-and-dissemination)

1.	A comprehensive publicity and advocacy plan should be put in place to target all populations especially the rural or urban residents, residents of formal or informal housing, participants in the formal or informal economy, fully literate, semi-literate, and illiterate groups, speakers of minority languages, recent internal or international migrants, remotely situated or nomadic populations. In addition, special messages should be tailored for the resistant communities.
2.	Publicity for the census should commence from the onset of the census process including during cartographic mapping and pre-enumeration listing, to the end.  This will help build the confidence of the public over time and mitigate issues such as fake advertisements. During the census preparatory phase, the implementing agencies need to undertake a wide publicity and advocacy campaign to inform the public of the census and to explain its purpose and hence mobilize support and participation. 
3.	The engagement of a communications firm to lead the process of publicity and advocacy plays a major role in getting the public and leaders to support the census. It is more impactful if the firm is brought on board early. A media firm should carry out road shows rather than the NSO as a good strategy for publicity.
4.	Procurement of publicity materials for the census should be finalized and distributed at least three months before the enumeration period. All the publicity activities should have adequate materials.
5.	It is important to train all persons that will be involved in the publicity campaigns to ensure uniformity and consistency. The media engagement training should be extended to more key personnel especially the CSOs to ensure they pass the correct message to the public.
6.	There should be strong political will built for the census to handle cases of shortage of funds or any other unexpected challenges for instance in Sierra Leone when the funder withdrew, Government came in to cover the funding gap.
7. NSOs need to plan for dissemination of results ahead of time as it informs resource allocation for the census. Having a successful dissemination schedule/plan necessitates all reports and publications to be produced and released within the timelines; A dissemination plan is priceless as it allows easy implementation of dissemination activities.
8. Solicit for the government political will and stakeholder involvement in all census phases to avoid rejection of results. For instance, engage the Office of the President during release of the data to build goodwill from the public as well as give adequate publicity for the dissemination.
9. Additionally, census implementing agencies should leverage on technology developments and social media platforms for the census products to reach a wider audience while taking care not to neglect those not able to access the technology.  
10. There is need to further decentralize the dissemination of census results from regional down to constituency levels.
11. User involvement is important and productive in all phases of census and development of thematic studies is better to prioritize engaging technical personnel from NSOs, universities and relevant Ministries.
