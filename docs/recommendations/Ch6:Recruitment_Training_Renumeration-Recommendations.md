# Chapter 06: Recruitment, Training and Renumeration - Recommendations
[back to Handbook Chapter 6](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/category/chapter-06-recruitment-training-and-renumeration)

1. A recruitment software/portal should be deployed to ease the process of receiving applications, shortlisting, and selection of personnel.
2. Provision of adequate workforce at the sub region (statistics offices if they exist) during the census period should be made.
3. The recruitment process should ensure strict adherence to the census timelines.
4. To have effective and successful training, there should be timely procurement of training venues. Endeavor to have face-to-face training while ensuring strict adherence to the census timelines.
5. The training schedule should be dynamic, using multiple training methods and materials. It should also match the caliber of people recruited. The training timetable and materials should be piloted and if any adjustments are required then they should be implemented in time.
6. Mechanisms to undertake verification of the details of the various census personnel needs to be in place to ensure that payments are not made to wrong persons and are done in a timely manner.
