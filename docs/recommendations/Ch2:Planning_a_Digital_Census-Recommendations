# Chapter 02: Planning a Digital Census - Recommendations
[back to Handbook Chapter 2](https://tech-acs.github.io/e-census-handbook/docs/category/chapter-02-planning-a-digital-census)

1.	The census planning should start several years in advance, utilize stakeholder engagements, and eventually obtain the political will to implement.
2.	A census plan should not be static but rather dynamic to accommodate any changes that may occur at any of the phases.
3. It is desirable to engage stakeholders and census experts to review the budget for support and completeness. Governments should be able to mobilize and avail adequate resources for the census undertaking.  In addition, countries need to avoid over reliance on donor funding. Countries should ensure timely disbursement of funds to avoid delays in implementation of activities.
4. For future PHCs, countries should officially pronounce the composition of committee members in time as a good gesture. This gives the legitimacy of the membership and ensures full representation of the necessary offices.
