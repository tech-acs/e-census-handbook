# Chapter 10: Enumeration - Recommendations
[back to Handbook Chapter 10](/docs/category/chapter-10-enumeration)

1. It is recommended that the pre-enumeration listing of households is done soon after the training and completed the day before enumeration starts and should have the community well informed. It should be done electronically for quick results.
2. The cartographic mapping process should be done well in advance of the enumeration and the pilot census should target the likely boundary problematic areas and test the map reading application thoroughly so that a uniform solution is got upfront.
3. Countries should develop a risk management plan for the enumeration phase, and the following recommendations are made:
    - In case of failure of some gadgets to send data to the server, there should be a clear strategy on alternative ways of how data can be sent such as: utilizing blue tooth sharing with supervisors or manually extracting data from the tablets. although the latter has a risk of total loss in case the tablet is lost. The ICT programmers come in handy for possible solutions and should always be available in sufficient numbers as well as the local administrators who can arbitrate in case of respondent refusals. 
    - A toll-free line provided to the public to make calls to the census call centre at the headquarters should be in place to easy communication between the office and the community during enumeration. 
4. The consequences of census data being of poor quality may be detrimental to policy decisions; more importantly and ultimately, the credibility of the entire census, the competency of the national statistical system, and the government itself will be put into question and the trust of society may never be fully recovered. It is highly recommended to have independent monitors during enumeration to enhance quality assurance.
