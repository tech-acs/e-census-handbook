# Chapter 13: Digital Census Archiving - Recommendations
[back to Handbook Chapter 13](/docs/category/chapter-13-digital-census-archiving)

1. A detailed guidance on the process of archiving individual census records should be included in the census legislation and should be in accordance with the countryâ€™s laws on archiving of official government documents and information. These provisions provide the legal basis for maintaining the archives and procedures related to the release of archived official government records.
2. The duration of retention of the various documents should be well thought out in time.
3. Archiving period should be specified for all digital data, supporting software or algorithms, and documentation to ensure that a service can be offered to users in the future.
4. The IT culture and facilities of the country and the census agency.
5. The nature and format of the census data files created in the data processing and dissemination phase. It is expected that the use of anonymized microdata becomes a standard feature of census data dissemination for the 2020 round of censuses.
6. The records should be stored using media with long-term stability and access to these media is carefully controlled.
7.	Additionally, the organizational policies should be considered such as: 
    -	Storage management policies for both paper and digital records.
    -	Management access control policy to maintain confidentiality through format and documentation standards.
    -	Emergency preparedness policies to limit damage from natural disasters or other emergencies.
    -	Disaster recovery policies to provide mechanisms for duplicating digital content and storing it in separate physical facilities (with regular back-ups).
    -	Security policies to prevent accidental or malicious loss.
