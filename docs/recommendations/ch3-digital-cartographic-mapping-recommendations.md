# Chapter 03: Digital Cartographic Mapping - Recommendations
[back to Handbook Chapter 3](/docs/category/chapter-03-digital-cartographic-mapping)

1.	Given the existing internet challenges in some parts of the continent, the choice of software should take into consideration the ability to work both online and offline.
2.	Benchmarking with countries that have already undertaken digital cartographic mapping is key in informing the mapping methodology and especially the choice of software. 
3.	Countries should develop their mapping tools and applications using internal capacity at the NSO like in Kenya, Namibia, Uganda  among others especially with the choice of simple and tried software such as ArcGIS-survey 123 with minimal support from Esri. 
4.	The use of open-source software should be explored given that it was proved to work and saves on costs, e.g., SmartClient that was used in Botswana.
5.	With any software development, it is important to give sufficient time to develop and test the cartographic system independently. The software manager must be the one to give the time needed to develop the system together with the census manager to be in sync with the overall census plan and timelines. Namibia had to postpone its first pilot testing because the duration that was allocated for programming tasks was not sufficient. The team had insufficient time allocations for developing and testing the application.
6.	Initial field tests of the mapping application should be done prior to the piloting exercise on a small scale to save costs and perfect the system instead of having two phases of piloting like was the case in Sierra Leone.
7.	Have a clear selection criterion of who should be part of the sensitization meetings, usually the most influential persons in the community are ideal and use trainers/facilitators who are conversant with the local language of the community so that they can translate the message and not use English to avoid any information loss.
8.	There is a need to provide timely communication for sensitization meetings to reduce on absenteeism of community leaders due to poor cellphone network and short notices. 
9.	Cascading and segmenting the mapping application among the field teams with their respective duties is a good practice to ensure quality control.
10.	Collecting GPS coordinates for the structures, households and features during the mapping is a good practice to ensure completeness and enhance spatial data analysis. However, it may slow down the mapping exercise during times when the internet is unstable due to weather etc. Therefore, mechanisms  should be put in place to control for displacement of GPS coordinates because of tall buildings and congested structures especially in urban centers.
11.	It is recommended that proper training and supervision of mapping assistants should be done to avoid the creation of gaps that could delay completion of delineation of EA boundaries. 
12.	NSOs should plan for adequate server space to accommodate the huge geo spatial data such as satellite imageries and aerial photographs. 
13.	There is need to plan for adequate editing personnel to avoid delaying the EA map editing process. 
14.	NSOs should plan for adequate GIS licenses and workstations to facilitate faster digitization process.
15.	NSOs should purchase adequate computer machines  with adequate capacity to process the complex and huge geospatial data. 
16.	It is important to start map production in time to enable earlier finalization to inform other census processes.
