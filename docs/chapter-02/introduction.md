# Introduction

Undertaking a population and housing census involves complex interrelated processes that require proper and timely planning. Census planning should aim to:

1.	Explain the dependencies between the different components of the census cycle.
2.	Ensure each phase has the necessary technical, logistical and administrative resources.
3.	Ensure that the output of each stage is a valuable input for subsequent phases.

This should be guided by the planning checklist ADD LINK TO CHECKLIST in this e-census handbook.
   
The quality and timeliness of the census data are highly influenced by the planning process. Census planning includes development of proposals, budgets, workplans, establishment of committees, mobilisation of resources and getting all legal and logistical processes in place.


The quality and timeliness of the census data are highly influenced by the planning process. tTherefore, sound technical considerations should guide each stage of implementation including the various administrative arrangements. Census planning entails development of proposals, budgets, workplans, establishment of committees, mobilizing resources and putting all the legal and logistical processes in place. 

## Census Planning during the non-digital vs digital era
Census planning in the non-digital era did not consider a lot of detail on technological aspects and therefore had less anticipated risk during data collection and was planned with a longer time span. While However, in the digital era, more thought is put on technology and the implementation timelines are shorter,. but t The procurement plans are more detailed and consultative with many more stakeholders needed to agree on specifications based on calculated opportunity cost.

This chapter points out selected country experiences, lessons learned and recommends recommendations on what should be done during a digital census planning process in the areas of developing the census proposal,,  budget and workplan as well as establishment of implementation committees.
