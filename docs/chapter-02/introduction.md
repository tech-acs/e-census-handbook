# Introduction

Undertaking a population and housing census involves complex interrelated processes that require proper and timely planning. Census planning should aim to:

1.	Explain the dependencies between the different components of the census cycle.
2.	Ensure each phase has the necessary technical, logistical and administrative resources.
3.	Ensure that the output of each stage is a valuable input for subsequent phases.
   
The quality and timeliness of the census data are highly influenced by the planning process. Census planning includes development of proposals, budgets, workplans, establishment of committees, mobilisation of resources and getting all legal and logistical processes in place.
