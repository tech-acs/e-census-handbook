# Introduction
Cartographic mapping is a major activity conducted during the pre-enumeration phase to create Enumeration Area (EA) maps. Such maps are used for the allocation of work during census enumeration as well as for dissemination of geospatial referenced census data. Therefore, the quality of maps used in the census has a major influence on the quality and reliability of census data collected. The mapping process involves the following activities: proposal development, mobilization of resources, development of tools, acquisition of equipment, publicity, piloting, recruitment, training, data collection, map production and EA map verification. <p>
**Cartographic mapping during the non-digital vs digital era**
Digital cartographic mapping involves the use of mobile technology for:
- collecting spatial data (GPS coordinates for structures, households, features such as schools, hospitals, churches, etc.) from the field to be used in delineation of EAs; 
- map production which includes overlaying of spatial data collected in the field on satellite imageries/aerial photos, digitization of EA boundaries, preparation of EA maps; 
- EA map verification.

Digital cartographic mapping has a wide range of benefits including better quality products, reduced cost, and reduced time for development of EA maps, increased accuracy, and improved consistency etc. (Handbook on geographic information systems and digital mapping, pg. 10-13).

In the non-digital era, all the above activities were manually done on paper and were prone to human error and produced bulky papers for field teams to carry around.

<strong>Considerations for digital cartographic mapping</strong><br>
To successfully, undertake digital cartographic mapping, NSOs are expected to have adequate GIS infrastructure in place. This includes a well-equipped GIS lab, a server with adequate space, up to date software, internet services and well-trained human resources as detailed in the manual on Geospatial Infrastructure in Support of Census Activities.

During the 2020 Round of PHC, most African countries embraced digital cartographic mapping. Some countries conducted purely digital cartographic mapping where mobile devices and remote sensing products were used while others embraced hybrid digital cartographic mapping. 
<br>
This chapter points out selected country experiences, lessons learned and recommendations on what should be done during digital cartographic mapping. Areas covered include developing the proposal, pilot testing, publicity and advocacy, actual data collection, production, and verification of maps as well as issues regarding the mapping personnel.

## 3.2 Pilot mapping 
Pilot mapping is conducted to test the preparedness to undertake the main cartographic mapping process. The aim is to test the validity and reliability of methodology, tools, and equipment to be used in the main cartographic mapping process. The findings from the pilot  inform the finalization of tools, instruments, and methodology. The pilot mapping process entails testing the suitability of the tools, logistical arrangements, assessing the workload, providing a basis for NSOs to mobilize resources and plan for an effective implementation of the process to ensure quality data is obtained. 

### 3.2.1	Selected country experiences
Census implementing agencies conducted comprehensive pilot mapping with varied objectives and implementation designs, below are some highlights of selected country experiences:
