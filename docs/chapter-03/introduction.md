# Introduction
Cartographic mapping is a major activity conducted during the pre-enumeration phase to create Enumeration Area (EA) maps. Such maps are used for the allocation of work during census enumeration as well as for dissemination of geospatial referenced census data. Therefore, the quality of maps used in the census has a major influence on the quality and reliability of census data collected. The mapping process involves the following activities: proposal development, mobilization of resources, development of tools, acquisition of equipment, publicity, piloting, recruitment, training, data collection, map production and EA map verification. <p>
<strong> Cartographic mapping during the non-digital vs digital era</strong>

Digital cartographic mapping involves the use of mobile technology for:
- collecting spatial data (GPS coordinates for structures, households, features such as schools, hospitals, churches, etc.) from the field to be used in delineation of EAs; 
- map production which includes overlaying of spatial data collected in the field on satellite imageries/aerial photos, digitization of EA boundaries, preparation of EA maps; 
- EA map verification. 
<br>
Digital cartographic mapping has a wide range of benefits including better quality products, reduced cost, and reduced time for development of EA maps, increased accuracy, and improved consistency etc. (Handbook on geographic information systems and digital mapping, pg. 10-13).
<br>
In the non-digital era, all the above activities were manually done on paper and were prone to human error and produced bulky papers for field teams to carry around.

<strong>Considerations for digital cartographic mapping</strong><br>
To successfully, undertake digital cartographic mapping, NSOs are expected to have adequate GIS infrastructure in place. This includes a well-equipped GIS lab, a server with adequate space, up to date software, internet services and well-trained human resources as detailed in the manual on Geospatial Infrastructure in Support of Census Activities. 
<br>
During the 2020 Round of PHC, most African countries embraced digital cartographic mapping. Some countries conducted purely digital cartographic mapping where mobile devices and remote sensing products were used while others embraced hybrid digital cartographic mapping. 
<br>
This chapter points out selected country experiences, lessons learned and recommendations on what should be done during digital cartographic mapping. Areas covered include developing the proposal, pilot testing, publicity and advocacy, actual data collection, production, and verification of maps as well as issues regarding the mapping personnel.

## 3.1 Development of digital cartographic mapping instruments and tools
Among the tools developed for digital cartographic mapping there are various forms used for sensitization, field mapping activities, verification, instructions manuals, digitization schemas, map templates as well as map editing, map production and verification. In development and finalization of these tools and instruments, most countries benchmarked and got inputs and assistance from other countries that had undertaken digital census mapping. The cartographic tools should be able to assign a unique coding and identification system to avoid any omissions .

### 3.1.1	Selected country experiences
As part of the digital cartographic mapping, all countries considered the most convenient technology and application to be used based on the intended output and cost. Below are some highlights of selected countries experiences regarding the output of the mapping, data collection forms used for mapping, and the software used.

<strong>Namibia</strong> aimed to provide detailed information regarding the use of built-up structures as well as develop a Statistics Business Register and the National Dwelling Unit Frame meant to provide detailed household and land use information for each Dwelling Unit.
<strong>Kenya </strong> aimed to update her geography file for all counties and sub-counties with villages and Enumeration Areas as well as number of households.
<strong>Sierra Leone </strong> aimed to achieve a verified and categorized nationwide locality list of all administrative levels showing the name of each locality, district, chiefdom, and section with a unique code.

#### 3.1.1.2	Data collection forms used for mapping
<strong>Kenya: </strong> Two household listing forms were developed: rural homestead and household listing form (F-54-5-1A and F-54-5-1B) and urban structure and household listing form (F-54-5-2) used for collecting data in rural and urban areas respectively, both collected the GPS coordinates for each household and their elevation. In addition, there was a summary form F-54-5-1A used by village elders while F-54-5-1B used by the data collection teams to compile villages and Enumeration Areas.

<strong>Sierra Leone:</strong> The cartographic mapping questionnaire was developed to capture information on, building use, locality class, classes of roads, water bodies and expected drainage type etc. The questionnaire was mainly designed to enable the head of the household to give information about the structure and number of members in the household. Other information was obtained using observation methods by the field staff.  

<strong>Namibia:</strong>The approach to questionnaire design focused on capturing the main elements relating to the use of a building and in the case of a dwelling unit, occupants were asked the name of the head of the household, contact details, the number of rooms, and the number of usual members residing in each dwelling unit including other basic services regarding the structure they reside in, such as the source of water, electricity, and access to sanitation. The inclusion of the many stakeholder requests changed the project from a typical cartographic exercise to a statistical undertaking.

<strong>Senegal:</strong> The design of the Mapping tools was a build up from versions of the previous census. They were finalized in technical workshops and bench-marking at INECV Cape Verde (for Cartography) and INSD Burkina Faso (for enumeration).
