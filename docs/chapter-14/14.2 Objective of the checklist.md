Given the challenges experienced in the 2020 round, this checklist aims to provide a systematic planning approach to guide stakeholders in ensuring that the plan for a digital PHC is coherent, coordinated and focused on efficiently meeting national development priorities, as well as maintain and reinvigorate momentum for a census undertaking in preparation for the 2030 round. The specific objectives are to: 
- •	Guide member states on how to prepare for a digital census undertaking.
- •	Provide support to the planning process for the 2030 Round. 
- •	Serve as a checklist for a successful census project management.

The checklist provides an outline to clarify the relationships between phases. Given that each phase of the census cycle is dependent on a preceding phase and the quality and timeliness of the output from each phase has a direct effect on the success of the next and subsequent phases.
