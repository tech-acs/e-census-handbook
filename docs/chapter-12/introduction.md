## 13.1 Introduction
After implementation of all census processes, several items are archived for future reference and use. These includes archiving of non-statistical data, statistical data, and various materials. Statistical data to be archived includes individual records. Technology and digital gadgets get obsolete at a higher rate compared to paper which may result into loss of census information sooner than expected. Therefore, in a digital census both electronic and non-electronic materials require to be archived.

The goal of implementing good archiving practices is to keep individual census records safe and available for future use by the government, researchers, and the various census stakeholders. Therefore,

-	a clear archiving strategy should be put in place to guide the process.
-	census offices should determine the materials and products to archive in time and put plans in place for the archiving process. 
-	The archiving plan should ensure that the process prolongs the usable life of archived records by preventing the loss of informational content. 
-	Before archiving of individual records, care must be taken to ensure confidentiality and privacy of the respondents. 
-	In the case of digital records, the accompanying documentation is an indispensable part of the archiving process because several variables in the digital record are presented as codes. It is necessary to archive all the codebooks and all the other documentation, such as the data collection instrument, that are needed for fully unlocking the value of each of the variables in the record.
-	NSOs should put in place proper technological infrastructure for the various components of microdata archiving i.e., data documentation, cataloguing and dissemination, anonymization, preservation etc.

**Key consideration for digital census archiving**

Before planning for archiving of the various items and products, the following should be taken into considerations:

-	A detailed guidance on the process of archiving individual census records should be included in the census legislation and should be in accordance with the countryâ€™s laws on archiving of official government documents and information. These provisions provide the legal basis for maintaining the archives and procedures related to the release of archived official government records.
-	The duration of retention of the various documents should be well thought out in time.
-	Archiving period should be specified for all digital data, supporting software or algorithms, and documentation to ensure that a service can be offered to users in the future.
-	The IT culture and facilities of the country and the census agency.
-	The nature and format of the census data files created in the data processing and dissemination phase. It is expected that the use of anonymized microdata becomes a standard feature of census data dissemination for the 2020 round of censuses.
-	The records should be stored using media with long-term stability and access to these media is carefully controlled.
-	Additionally, the organizational policies should be considered such as: 
-	Storage management policies for both paper and digital records.
-	Management access control policy to maintain confidentiality through format and documentation standards.
-	Emergency preparedness policies to limit damage from natural disasters or other emergencies.
-	Disaster recovery policies to provide mechanisms for duplicating digital content and storing it in separate physical facilities (with regular back-ups).
-	Security policies to prevent accidental or malicious loss.
