## 12.3 Development of Census Dissemination Products
### 12.3.1 The process
The development of census dissemination products is a process typically led by the NSO and production of census products is part of the census process. The following considerations should be made:
- Before producing census dissemination products, NSOs must identify what products are appropriate and need to be generated to meet the stakeholder needs. This is determined through stakeholder engagements at the planning stage.
- Census dissemination products should be developed for various stakeholder groups as stakeholder segmentation improves understanding and utilization of the developed products.  
- Partnership with national / international stakeholders is a common practice in the production of census products. There are various operational modalities for producing census products. There is no one-fits-all approach, common ones include: 
  - NSO to undertake the entire tasks in partnership with sectoral ministries; National academic or public research institution lead NSO and sectoral ministries -this could be under an MOU or contracting the services. 
  - Donors provide resources to hire research institutions or national/international consultant(s) to lead in areas/topics where national capacity is lacking in partnership with NSO and sectoral ministries/national institutions. 
  - Outsourcing by subcontracting the entire production of census products either to national or international research institutions and/or consultants. 
- In development of census products there should be clear stakeholder roles based on their comparative advantage. The roles and responsibilities should be clear at the planning stage such as: 
  - The Census implementing agency has the technical and management leadership; planning of the census products’ release schedule; data analysis and content production; dissemination as well as data sharing if required. 
  - Sectoral ministries guide selection of topics, give sectoral expertise; policy analysis; quality assurance, and data utilization for evidence-based decision-making.
  - Academia and national researchers provide research capacity; advanced statistical expertise; disciplinary and context-specific knowledge.
  - International consultants and research firms provide supplementary capacity for research and analysis, outsourcing of recruitment / contract management. 
  - Development partners provide resource mobilization; technical support; operational support; promotion of international standards and best practices; quality assurance and capacity building at the NSO if required.
  - Donors provide funding, prioritization of topics and data utilization for development programs.
- Other factors to be considered when preparing the implementation plan include availability of human resources at NSO; research capacity in national government and academic institutions; technical assistance / capacity building required; composition of research teams; sequence of the thematic reports; budget; and access to data.
  
When developing census products, the following checklist should be put in consideration:
1.	Functionality – it does what users need it to do; 
2.	Usability – is easy for people to access and use; 
3.	Reusable – design is reusable, people can reuse the product; 
4.	Helpful features – should solve users’ problems; 
5.	Findable – clear product name or title, matches what users will use as search terms online; 
6.  Look and feel – no clutter, consistent language, and looks professional.
